Something magical...

# Project Title - ScranHub

Team Project involving APIs and an idea based around an interactive front-end application.

## Project Description/Overview

Provide a clear and concise overview of your project. Explain its purpose, goals, and any relevant background information. Include the names of the group members and their roles in the project.

- Our idea was to build a food locator application with the purpose to allow users to search for local food services or restaurants within a specified distance. They would then get results depending on their key words they used to search. 
So to start we broke down the project into different steps to delagate the work between the five group members. Myra, Jack, Anthony, Mohamed and Louis

Once searched keywords they will be presented with up to six results depending on the keywords entered.
